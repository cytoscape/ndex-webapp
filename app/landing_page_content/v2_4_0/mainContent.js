'<br> <p>The public NDEx site includes a number of features to promote and support publishing of data in network format. Although published networks will typically be associated with research articles, there are cases where authors will decide to publish network data independently from a canonical scientific journal article. For example, researchers generating networks from large datasets using automated analytic pipelines may wish to make their results available on an ongoing basis.</p>' +

'<h3>Peer-reviewed Journal Articles</h3>' +
'<p>Besides its use in pre-publication and collaborative research efforts, NDEx can also be a useful asset for the publication of networks referenced in peer-reviewed journal articles. <br>' +
'Advantages for authors include easy network storage/retrieval, full Cytoscape integration and DOI minting, while publishers can rely on a simplified submission management (no supplemental data, tables or figures necessary), improved anonymous web-based review process (using interactive networks rather than tabular data) and better/faster access to published data by hyperlinking figures in articles directly to networks in NDEx via URLs or DOIs.' +
'<br>The following sections summarize how to use NDEx and its built-in features throughout the entire publication process.</p><br>',

'<p>It is OK to use the NDEx public server for the operations specified in our tutorials, using the suggested example networks, but once you start developing in earnest, it\'s better to experiment in an environment where errors have limited consequences:</p>' +
'<p>1. Please read the full document explaining how to work with networks <a href="../using-the-ndex-server-api/">using the NDEx API</a>.</p>' +
'<p>2. You can run your own NDEx Server and test your applications locally. Please check our <a href="../installation-instructions/">installation instructions</a> to download and install your own NDEx Server instance.</p>' +
'<p>3. For applications that use the NDEx public server, be considerate of other users: <b>design your application with server load in mind! </b>For example, caching of the results of repetitive requests will reduce server load and typically improve the performance of an application.</p>' +

The goal of CyNDEx is to be both easy to install and easy to use. If you have any ideas for how it could be even better, we want to hear from you!',
